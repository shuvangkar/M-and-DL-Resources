## Basic Theory & Understanding
* [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
This youtube playlist is just awesome to understand the neural network. It will grow your intuition how neural network works under the hood.The animation is really appreciated.

## For Coding
* [Machine Learning Mastery Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/category/deep-learning/) 
This is a very good blog to practice deep learning models with Keras. The explains the problem and source in a good way. I recommend this blog for getting started. 

## CNN
* [Convolutional Neural Network for Dummies](https://www.kaggle.com/iamsouravbanerjee/convolutional-neural-network-for-dummies) Good blog to understand simply
